# Lox Interpreter

This is an interpreter for the Lox programming language, built in Java. Lox is a programming language designed by Bob Nystrom, and you can find more information about its design and features on his [blog](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/).

## Features

The Lox interpreter implements the following features:

- Dynamic typing: Lox uses a dynamic type system that allows assigning values of different types to the same variable.

- Object-oriented: Lox supports object-oriented programming, allowing class definitions, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- Closures: Lox allows the creation of closures, which are functions that capture variables from the environment in which they were defined.

- Flow control: Lox provides flow control structures like loops and conditionals to facilitate the creation of complex algorithms.

- I/O operations: The Lox interpreter provides basic input/output operations to read and write data from/to the console.

## System Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
